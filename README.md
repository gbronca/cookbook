# Cookbook Project

About a year ago I have decided to adopt a helthier lifestyle and part of this change was based on health eating. I have seen several interesting recipes online but had no system to store them so I could refer back when needed.

The idea of building a recipes website for my 4th project for the Code Institute Full Stack Developer Course was just inline with a personal project.

## UX

### User Stories

1. **WIP** As a visitor, I would like to be able to browse and search for recipes that fit some specific criterias.

2. **WIP** As a user, I should be able to like recipes

3. **WIP** A user should be able to search for most liked recipes.

4. A user should be able to create an account.

5. **WIP** A registered user should be able to add recipes and edit the recipes he/she have added.

6. **WIP** A registered user should be able to comment on other recipes
